message: "Great post thanks!\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the way you deal with dependencies can differ wether your are building an image for a local dev environment or for production.\r\n`\r\nOn my local dev machine I use bundle check || bundle cache in the entrypoint script.\r\nThat way my rails dependencies are stored in vendor/cache in the rails project folder.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to \"cache\" the dependencies in an image used for a dev environment:\r\nThis is only done for performance purpose on CI/CD or for production release."
